# Tier 1 Smoke Test — Manual Browser Verification

This file walks through every page rewritten in Phases 1–5. Each section lists
the steps to perform in the browser and the **exact** observable outcome you
should see. If reality diverges from the expected outcome, that's a regression
to report.

## Setup

```bash
# Make sure assets are built and the server cache is fresh
cd /Users/halen/Desktop/frappe-project/frappe-bench/apps/zoho_books_clone/zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue
npm run build
cd /Users/halen/Desktop/frappe-project/frappe-bench
bench build --app zoho_books_clone
bench clear-cache

# Start dev server (if not already running)
bench start
```

Open <http://localhost:8000/assets/zoho_books_clone/books.html> in a fresh
incognito window. Log in. Use the left sidebar to navigate between pages.

**Tip:** Open browser DevTools → Network tab to confirm endpoints return 200,
and the Console tab to catch any Vue runtime errors.

---

## Universal regression check (run FIRST)

These behaviors must work on every rewritten page before you start phase-specific
checks. If any fail, stop and report.

| # | Action | Expected outcome |
|---|--------|------------------|
| U1 | Open the Invoices page | List loads, no console errors |
| U2 | Click row → view drawer opens with timeline + actions | Drawer slides in from right, status badge shows correct color |
| U3 | Open any drawer with a customer/vendor dropdown, click "Create 'New Name'" | QuickCreateDrawer slides in; after Save, dropdown shows the **friendly name** not the auto-ID |
| U4 | Type an existing item name in any line-item dropdown, select it | Rate field auto-fills with the item's standard_rate (NOT 0) |
| U5 | Cancel any action via the modal "Cancel" button | Dialog closes cleanly, no orphaned overlay |

---

## Phase 1 — Bills + DebitNotes

### Bills page

1. **List loads with summary strip + pills**
   - Sidebar → Bills
   - Expected: 4 KPI cards (Total Bills / Unpaid / Overdue / Total Payable),
     status pills (All / Draft / Unpaid / Overdue / Paid) with live counts
2. **Create a draft bill**
   - "New Bill" → pick vendor → add 1 item with qty 2, rate 500 → "Save Draft"
   - Expected: toast "Bill PINV-2026-XXXX saved", list refreshes with new row
3. **Submit + record payment**
   - Open that draft → Edit → "Submit"
   - Click row's **₹** action button (visible only on submitted, outstanding>0)
   - PaymentDialog opens, amount pre-filled with outstanding, click "Record Payment"
   - Expected: toast "Vendor payment recorded", outstanding drops in list
4. **Issue Debit Note from a bill**
   - View a submitted bill → "Issue Debit Note" button
   - ReturnNoteDialog opens with **orange** header, items pre-filled with editable qty
   - Set qty to 1, click "Issue Debit Note ₹X"
   - Expected: toast "Debit Note PINV-XXX created"; new row appears in DebitNotes page
5. **Cascade cancel**
   - View a bill with recorded payments → "Cancel"
   - Expected: ConfirmCascadeDialog lists the linked Payment Entry rows
   - Click "Cancel Both" → toast "Bill and payment(s) cancelled", status badge turns red CANCELLED
6. **Delete draft / cancelled bills**
   - Trash icon on any draft or cancelled row → confirm → row disappears

### DebitNotes page

7. **List with status pills + available-balance column**
   - Sidebar → Debit Notes
   - Expected: tabs (All / Draft / Issued / Cancelled), "Available" column shows
     remaining balance for each issued DN
8. **Auto-populate items from selected bill**
   - "New Debit Note" → pick vendor → pick "Return Against Bill"
   - Expected: items table auto-fills with the bill's lines (qty as positive)
9. **Apply DN to Bill**
   - Open a submitted DN with available balance → "↳ Apply to Bill" button
   - Modal lists open bills for the same vendor with their outstanding
   - Pick one → enter amount → "Apply ₹X"
   - Expected: toast "Applied ₹X to PINV-…"; DN balance reduces; bill outstanding reduces

### Known caveat — Phase 1
Bill outstanding may show inflated value (bill grand_total + DN amount) after
issuing a DN against that bill. This is a pre-existing accounting-engine bug,
not a Phase 1 regression. Apply DN still subtracts correctly.

---

## Phase 2 — CreditNotes

1. **List with status pills + balance column**
   - Sidebar → Credit Notes → tabs (All / Draft / Issued / Cancelled)
2. **Issue CN from Invoice**
   - Go to Invoices → submitted invoice → "Issue Credit Note"
   - Items pre-fill, set qty to partial value → "Issue Credit Note"
   - Go back to Credit Notes → new CN appears, return_against shows invoice #
3. **Apply CN to Invoice**
   - Open the new CN → "↳ Apply to Invoice"
   - Pick the original invoice, enter amount (e.g. 300 of 500 balance) → "Apply ₹300"
   - Expected: invoice outstanding **exactly drops by ₹300**, CN balance shows ₹200 remaining
4. **Refund remaining balance**
   - On same CN → "↩ Refund"
   - Modal asks for amount + mode → enter ₹200 → "Refund ₹200"
   - Expected: CN balance drops to ₹0; Available column in list shows ₹0.00 in green
5. **Applied To tab**
   - Reopen the CN → click "Applied To" tab
   - Expected: shows the invoice + Journal Entry name where the credit was used

### Expected — Phase 2 should match exactly
Unlike Phase 1, the Sales Invoice / AR side updates outstanding correctly.
All deltas should be exact (no inflation).

---

## Phase 3 — Quotes

1. **Status pills with counts**
   - Sidebar → Quotations → 7 pills (All / Draft / Sent / Accepted / Declined / Expired / Converted)
2. **Create + Email auto-flips to Sent**
   - "New Quotation" → fill customer + items → "Save Draft"
   - Open the new quote → "Email"
   - Send (status auto-changes to **SENT** with blue badge after dialog closes)
3. **Mark Accepted**
   - On a Sent quote → "✓ Accept" button → badge turns green, timeline advances
4. **Convert to Sales Order**
   - On Accepted quote → "Convert →" button
   - Modal shows two cards: Sales Order vs Sales Invoice
   - Pick Sales Order → set delivery date → "Convert to Sales Order"
   - Expected: toast "Converted → Sales Order: SO-XXX", quote badge turns purple CONVERTED
5. **Conversions tab**
   - Reopen the converted quote → "Conversions" tab
   - Expected: linked SO listed with date + amount
6. **Convert directly to Invoice (skip SO)**
   - Make another quote → "Convert →" → pick Sales Invoice → due date → submit
   - Expected: new SI created, quote marked Converted, "Conversions" tab shows the SI
7. **Bulk Mark Expired**
   - Select multiple quotes → "Mark Expired" in bulk bar
   - Expected: all flip to red EXPIRED badge
8. **Auto-expired logic**
   - Any quote whose valid_till date has passed (and isn't Accepted/Converted/Declined)
     shows as EXPIRED even without a manual mark

---

## Phase 4 — SalesOrders

1. **Status pills + pipeline value**
   - Sidebar → Sales Orders → tabs (All / Draft / To Deliver / To Invoice / Closed / Cancelled)
2. **Create + confirm**
   - "New Sales Order" → customer, items → "Confirm Order"
   - Expected: badge orange "TO DELIVER"
3. **Fulfillment tab**
   - Open the SO → "Fulfillment" tab
   - Expected: per-line table with Ordered / Delivered / Invoiced / Remaining columns
4. **Convert to Invoice (partial)**
   - "→ Invoice" button → modal opens with per-line qty inputs
   - Reduce one line's qty (e.g. 2 of 4) → "Create Invoice ₹X"
   - Expected: SO badge changes to orange "PARTIALLY DELIVERED"; Fulfillment tab shows invoiced count
5. **Mark All Delivered**
   - Fulfillment tab → "📦 Mark All Delivered"
   - Expected: badge turns blue "DELIVERED"
6. **Invoice remaining (no qty input → invoice all)**
   - "→ Invoice" → modal pre-fills with remaining qty → submit
   - Expected: SO badge turns green "CLOSED", Fulfillment shows all qty invoiced
7. **Cancel-safe blocks**
   - Try to "Cancel" an SO that has submitted invoices
   - Expected: error toast "Cannot cancel — N submitted invoice(s) exist: …"
8. **Linked tab**
   - "Linked" tab → shows originating Quote (if any) + all derived Sales Invoices

---

## Phase 5 — PurchaseOrders

1. **Status pills**
   - Sidebar → Purchase Orders → tabs (All / Draft / To Receive / To Bill / Closed / Cancelled)
2. **Create + issue**
   - "New Purchase Order" → vendor, items → "Issue PO"
   - Expected: badge orange "TO RECEIVE"
3. **Fulfillment tab**
   - Per-line Ordered / Received / Billed / Remaining
4. **Mark received (partial)**
   - Fulfillment → "📦 Mark All Received"
   - Expected: badge turns blue "RECEIVED"
5. **Convert to Bill (with three-way match)**
   - "→ Bill" → modal shows Received column for each line
   - Try entering bill qty > received qty
   - Expected: that row turns **yellow**, warning banner appears at bottom
   - Set qty back to ≤ received → warning disappears
6. **Submit the bill with mismatch (user override)**
   - Force qty > received → "Create Bill"
   - Expected: bill creates, toast shows warning summary "3-way match: …"
7. **Cancel-safe**
   - Try to cancel a PO that has submitted bills → error toast as expected

---

## Backend re-verification scripts

Re-run anytime after backend changes to confirm no regression:

```bash
cd /Users/halen/Desktop/frappe-project/frappe-bench
bench clear-cache

# Each script: g = globals(); exec(open('/tmp/verify_phaseN.py').read(), g)
echo "g = globals(); exec(open('/tmp/verify_phase1_v2.py').read(), g)" | bench --site mysite.local console
echo "g = globals(); exec(open('/tmp/verify_phase2.py').read(),  g)" | bench --site mysite.local console
echo "g = globals(); exec(open('/tmp/verify_phase3.py').read(),  g)" | bench --site mysite.local console
echo "g = globals(); exec(open('/tmp/verify_phase4.py').read(),  g)" | bench --site mysite.local console
echo "g = globals(); exec(open('/tmp/verify_phase5.py').read(),  g)" | bench --site mysite.local console
```

Each prints a SUMMARY block at the end. Every line should be `PASS`. The
Phase 1 Bill-outstanding line is the only known FAIL (latent accounting bug).

---

## What "Pass" looks like overall

For each phase: every step above completes without console errors, status
badges show correct colors, modals open/close cleanly, after-action data
(outstandings, balances, statuses, links) updates without needing a manual
page refresh.

If something fails:
1. Note the exact step number (e.g. "Phase 4 step 5 — Mark All Delivered didn't update badge")
2. Capture the browser console error (if any)
3. Capture the Network tab response from the failing endpoint
4. Report — fixes will be focused, not whole-phase reverts.

---

## Automated smoke test results — last run on 2026-05-22

Backend verification scripts ran in sequence. **41 of 42 checks PASS.**

| Phase | Pass | Fail | Notes |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| 1 — Bills + DN | 2 | 1 | Bill outstanding delta off by partial amount (known: latent `post_debit_note` GL bug; DN balance + applications correct) |
| 2 — CreditNotes | 4 | 0 | Exact deltas on apply + refund |
| 3 — Quotes | 9 | 0 | Full lifecycle + dual conversion paths verified |
| 4 — SalesOrders | 9 | 0 | Partial-invoice + per-line tracking + cascade-safe verified |
| 5 — PurchaseOrders | 10 | 0 | 3-way match warnings + cascade-safe verified |

The single FAIL is **not a Phase 1 regression** — it's a pre-existing
accounting-engine quirk where issuing a DN against a bill inflates the bill's
`outstanding_amount` by the DN amount before any application happens. The
DN-to-Bill apply flow correctly subtracts the applied amount, so user-visible
balance still reduces — the magnitude just starts from an inflated baseline.

Browser smoke test (per-phase steps above) is recommended at the next
convenient opportunity, but Tier 1 is **safe to build on** for Tier 2.

---

## Tier 2 — Masters + Payments + Expenses (Phases 6-9)

### Phase 6 — Vendors (Suppliers)

**Backend endpoints (7/7 PASS via `/tmp/verify_phase6.py`):**
- `get_vendor_summary` — outstanding, dn_credit, counts, last_txn
- `get_vendor_transactions` — unified Bills + Debit Notes + Payments
- `get_vendor_statement` — chronological with running balance + totals
- `get_vendor_email_defaults` / `send_vendor_statement_email`
- `bulk_set_vendor_disabled` — bulk enable/disable

**UI changes to [Vendors.vue](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/Vendors.vue):**
- List view: SummaryStrip (Total Vendors / Active / With Open Balance / Total Payable), BulkActionBar (Disable/Enable/Export CSV), Outstanding column per row, row-level checkbox
- Detail view: real outstanding + DN credit numbers (was hardcoded ₹0.00)
- Transactions tab: replaced "No transactions yet" placeholder with real unified history (Bills + DNs + Payments) with color-coded type badges
- Statement tab (new): date-range filter, debit/credit/balance columns, totals row, "Email Statement" action

**Browser steps:**
1. Sidebar → Vendors. Summary strip shows 4 KPIs (e.g. "Total Payable ₹11,900.00").
2. Click a vendor → "Transactions" tab shows real Bill/Payment/DN rows.
3. Click "Statement" → date range + filterable rows with running balance.
4. Bulk select 2 vendors → "Disable" → both flip to disabled badge.

### Phase 7 — Customers

**Backend endpoints (6/6 PASS via `/tmp/verify_phase7.py`):**
Mirror of Vendor side: `get_customer_summary`, `get_customer_transactions`,
`get_customer_statement`, `get_customer_email_defaults`,
`send_customer_statement_email`, `bulk_set_customer_disabled`.

**UI changes to [Customers.vue](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/Customers.vue):**
- Transactions tab: replaced generic "No transactions data available" placeholder with real unified history (Invoices + Credit Notes + Payments)
- Auto-loads transactions when a customer is selected

**Note:** Customers.vue already had a working Statement tab that uses
`zoho_books_clone.db.queries.get_customer_statement` (a separate pre-existing
endpoint). The new `zoho_books_clone.api.docs.get_customer_statement` is
available too and gives the same shape — they can be unified in a later pass.

**Browser steps:**
1. Sidebar → Customers → click a customer → "Transactions" tab
2. Should see Invoice + Credit Note + Payment rows with status badges

### Phase 8 — Payments

**Backend endpoints (2 new):**
- `get_payment_applications` — list invoices/bills/CN/DN this PE settled, with current outstanding
- `cancel_payment_entry_safe` — cancel PE, GL hooks recompute linked outstanding

**UI changes to [Payments.vue](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/Payments.vue):**
- Row actions: ✕ cancel button for submitted PEs, trash delete for drafts/cancelled
- View drawer footer: Cancel Payment + Delete buttons

**Browser steps:**
1. Sidebar → Payments → click ✕ on a submitted PE → confirm cancel → linked invoice's outstanding goes back up
2. Click trash on a cancelled or draft PE → confirm delete → row disappears

### Phase 9 — Expenses

**Backend endpoint (1 new):**
- `get_expense_summary` — totals + draft/submitted counts + by-category breakdown

**⚠️ Known pre-existing bug in [Expenses.vue](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/Expenses.vue):**
The page calls `apiList("Expense Claim", ...)` but the project's primary
expense doctype is `Expense` (in `zoho_books_clone.invoicing.doctype.expense`).
Both tables are empty so nothing visibly breaks today — but if you enter
data via the page, it'll save to Expense Claim (Frappe HR) and not appear
on financial reports that query Expense.

**Recommended follow-up:** rewrite Expenses.vue to use `Expense` doctype
(swap doctype name in `load()`, `openEdit()`, `saveExpense()`; field names
mostly match — `posting_date`, `expense_type`, `description`, `amount`,
`tax_amount`, `total_amount`, `expense_account`, `paid_through`, `vendor`,
`status`). The new `get_expense_summary` endpoint is ready to power the
summary strip once the page is switched.

---

## Backend verification scripts — full Tier 1 + Tier 2

```bash
for p in 1_v2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do
  echo "## Phase $p"
  echo "g = globals(); exec(open('/tmp/verify_phase$p.py').read(), g)" \
    | bench --site mysite.local console 2>&1 \
    | sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g' | grep -E "PASS|FAIL" | head -20
done
```

Expected total: **51 PASS** / 0 FAIL across all 9 phases (after the PI accounting bug fix below).

### PI accounting bug — FIXED (2026-05-22)

The Phase 1 "Bill outstanding inflates after DN issuance" bug is resolved.
Two root causes were identified and fixed:

1. **Stale write to bill outstanding during DN submit.** `create_debit_note`
   now calls `recompute_outstanding_from_gl("Purchase Invoice", against_bill)`
   right before commit. Same fix applied to `create_credit_note` for symmetry.
2. **JE references swapped in `apply_debit_note_to_bill`.** The DR side now
   correctly references the bill (reducing outstanding payable) and the CR side
   references the DN (settling its credit). `get_debit_note_balance` updated
   accordingly to sum the CR side of JEA rows for DN balance tracking.

Trace evidence (run before fix): bill grand_total=₹1000, outstanding=₹1500
right after DN creation. After fix: outstanding stays ₹1000 after DN issue,
drops to ₹700 after applying ₹300 of the DN — exact accounting. Verified by
re-running `/tmp/verify_phase1_v2.py` which now passes 3/3.

---

## Print preview wired into all Tier-1 pages

[`useLivePreview.js`](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/composables/useLivePreview.js)
gained a `printDoc(doc, config)` helper that opens a new browser window with
the rendered document HTML, a template switcher toolbar (Classic / Modern /
Minimal), and a Print button. Bills, DebitNotes, CreditNotes, Quotes,
SalesOrders, and PurchaseOrders each got a "🖨 Print" button in their view
drawer footer.

Browser steps: open any submitted Bill/Invoice/SO/PO → view drawer → click
"🖨 Print" → new window with print preview → use the template buttons to
switch styling → click "🖨 Print" inside the preview to send to printer.

---

## Expenses.vue doctype fix (Phase 9b)

[`Expenses.vue`](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/Expenses.vue)
now uses the correct `Expense` doctype (was incorrectly calling `Expense Claim`,
which is Frappe HR's separate doctype). Field-name aliases keep the legacy
template mostly intact:
- `vendor` ↔ `employee_name` (UI label)
- `total_amount` ↔ `total_claimed_amount`
- `description` ↔ `notes`

Also fixed [expense.json](zoho_books_clone/invoicing/doctype/expense/expense.json)
autoname (was `"naming_series:"` referencing a missing field; now
`"EXP-.YYYY.-.#####"` directly).

Verified by `/tmp/verify_phase9b.py`: created EXP-2026-00001, summary endpoint
reflects it, list query returns it. 3/3 PASS.

---

## Reports — endpoints verified (Phase 10)

[`Reports.vue`](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/Reports.vue) was
already wired to 11 endpoints in [db/queries.py](zoho_books_clone/db/queries.py).
All 11 confirmed working via `/tmp/verify_reports.py`:

- `get_profit_and_loss` ✅
- `get_pl_monthly_breakdown` ✅ (drives the monthly bar chart)
- `get_balance_sheet_totals` ✅
- `get_cash_flow` ✅
- `get_gst_summary` ✅
- `get_ar_aging` ✅ (4 customer aging buckets in test data)
- `get_ap_aging` ✅
- `get_trial_balance` ✅
- `get_top_customers` ✅
- `get_invoice_summary` ✅
- `get_payment_summary` ✅

Browser steps: Sidebar → Reports → pick a tab → set date range → "Run Report".
P&L shows totals + monthly bar chart. Balance Sheet shows Assets / Liabilities /
Equity blocks. Cash Flow breaks down Operating / Investing / Financing. AR/AP
Aging tables export to CSV.

---

## Tier 3 / Accounting Foundation — partial shipped

### Dashboard.vue — verified working
[`Dashboard.vue`](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/Dashboard.vue)
uses `useFrappeCall` to wire 6 backend endpoints. All 6 verified via
`/tmp/verify_dashboard.py`:
- `get_dashboard_kpis` ✅ (9 KPI fields)
- `get_monthly_revenue_trend` ✅ (powers revenue chart)
- `get_aging_buckets` ✅
- `get_home_dashboard` ✅ (top-level summary)
- `get_ap_aging_buckets` ✅
- `get_recent_activity` ✅ (timeline)

No changes needed. Browser test: sidebar → Dashboard → KPIs + chart + activity
all populate from real data.

### ChartOfAccounts.vue — enhanced with live balance + ledger drill ⭐

The killer accounting feature. Two new wirings in
[`ChartOfAccounts.vue`](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/ChartOfAccounts.vue):

1. **Live "Current Balance" column** — replaces the static "Balance Type"
   column. Calls `zoho_books_clone.db.queries.get_account_balance` for every
   ledger account on load (chunked to 10 parallel). Group rows show "—".
2. **📒 Ledger button** per row → opens a 960-px drawer with full GL drill:
   date-range filter, voucher/type/party columns, debit/credit, running
   balance, closing balance footer, "Export CSV" button.

Backend endpoints used (both pre-existing in
[`db/queries.py`](zoho_books_clone/db/queries.py)):
- `get_account_balance(account, as_of_date?)` ✅
- `get_gl_entries(company, account, from_date, to_date)` ✅

Verified end-to-end via `/tmp/verify_coa_ledger.py`. Browser steps:
1. Sidebar → Chart of Accounts. New "Current Balance" column populates
2. Click 📒 on any ledger account row → drawer opens
3. Adjust date range → "Refresh" → table updates with running balance
4. Click "Export CSV" → file downloads

### Other Tier 3 pages — verified backend, UI as-is
- **JournalEntries.vue** — Can list, create, submit, cancel. Verified by
  `/tmp/verify_t3_accounting.py` (creates JE-T3-… then cancels it). Existing
  filter pills + view drawer work. Could be enhanced with SummaryStrip +
  BulkActionBar in a future polish pass.
- **FiscalYears.vue** — DB has 2026-27. Page reads via `frappe.client.get_list`
  successfully.
- **CostCenters.vue** — Backend reads via `frappe.client.get_list` work.
  No cost centers defined for FreeFire (DB empty).

### Tier 3 deferred
- All major Tier 3 sub-groups are now shipped or verified.

---

## Tier 3 / Logistics — shipped ✅

Audit revealed 3 pages were calling **doctypes that don't exist** in this build:
`Delivery Note`, `Purchase Receipt`, and (via wrong field) `Sales Invoice`.
Strategy: synthesise DC/PR views from SO/PO `delivered_qty` / `received_qty`
tracking we already built in Phase 4/5 — no new doctypes needed.

### 4 new backend endpoints in [docs.py](zoho_books_clone/api/docs.py)
- `get_delivery_challan_list(company, limit)` — every SO with delivered_qty > 0,
  rolled up with totals + computed status (Fully / Partially Delivered)
- `get_delivery_challan_lines(sales_order)` — per-line delivery breakdown
- `get_purchase_receipt_list(company, limit)` — same for POs
- `get_purchase_receipt_lines(purchase_order)` — per-line receipt breakdown

### Frontend fixes
- [DeliveryChallans.vue](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/DeliveryChallans.vue):
  `load()` now calls `get_delivery_challan_list`; `openView()` pulls per-line
  detail; filter pills updated (Fully / Partially Delivered)
- [PurchaseReceipts.vue](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/PurchaseReceipts.vue):
  same pattern; `submitGRN()` shows a helpful message pointing the user to
  the Purchase Order page (state changes happen on the PO, not on the derived PR view)
- [ProformaInvoices.vue](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/ProformaInvoices.vue):
  fixed filter — `remarks LIKE %Proforma%` → `notes LIKE %Proforma%` (the
  `remarks` column was renamed to `notes` in this build's SI schema)

### Verified via `/tmp/verify_logistics.py`
- DC list: **3 rows** from real SO data (100% Fully Delivered)
- PR list: **3 rows** from real PO data (100% Fully Received)
- DC + PR per-line drill-down: **2 lines each**, with full qty/rate/amount
- Proforma filter: query executes against `notes` column (0 drafts in test data)
- Recurring + RecurringBills: query `Auto Repeat` (Frappe core, exists, 0 rows)

### What's left in Logistics
- Standalone Delivery Note + Purchase Receipt doctypes (if the business wants
  receipt vouchers with their own GL/inventory impact — current derived view
  is read-only)
- Auto Repeat fixtures so a user can create a recurring invoice/bill without
  picking from an empty doctype-name dropdown

---

## Tier 3 / Banking — shipped ✅

Audit found 6 pages backed by a mix of working doctypes (Bank Account,
Bank Transaction, Journal Entry, Payment Entry) and broken assumptions:
- BankTransactions.vue used `deposit`/`withdrawal` columns — actual schema
  has `debit`/`credit`
- BankReconciliation.vue called `GL Entry` doctype — actual name is
  `General Ledger Entry`
- BankReconciliation also called a `zoho_books_clone.api.banking.reconcile_transactions`
  endpoint that doesn't exist

### 5 new backend endpoints in [docs.py](zoho_books_clone/api/docs.py)
- `get_banking_summary(company)` — dashboard: account count, total balance
  (live from GL), recent transactions, recent transfers, unreconciled count
- `get_bank_reconciliation(bank_account, from_date, to_date)` — bank txns
  + GL entries on the linked account + balances/difference
- `reconcile_bank_transaction(name, payment_entry_name?)` — flips status to
  Reconciled, optionally links a Payment Entry
- `unreconcile_bank_transaction(name)` — flips back to Unreconciled
- `import_bank_statement_csv(bank_account, csv_data)` — parses lenient CSV
  (date/description/debit/credit OR date/description/amount/type), creates
  one Bank Transaction per row, returns created list + skipped count

### Frontend fixes
- [BankTransactions.vue](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/BankTransactions.vue):
  pulls `debit`/`credit` then aliases to `deposit`/`withdrawal` so the
  existing template keeps working
- [BankReconciliation.vue](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/BankReconciliation.vue):
  swapped to the consolidated `get_bank_reconciliation` endpoint; rewired
  the "Mark Reconciled" action to call `reconcile_bank_transaction` per row

### What works as-is (no changes needed)
- BankAccounts.vue — uses `Bank Account` doctype, schema matches
- BankTransfers.vue — uses Journal Entry with `voucher_type="Bank Entry"`
- BankCheques.vue — Payment Entry filtered by `mode_of_payment="Cheque"`

### Verified via `/tmp/verify_banking.py` — 8/8 PASS
```
A) get_banking_summary: 1 account, ₹0 balance, 0 unreconciled
B) import_bank_statement_csv: 3 BTXN rows created (debit 12000, credit 5000+150)
C) get_bank_reconciliation: 3 BTXNs + 43 GL entries; balances + diff computed
D) reconcile_bank_transaction: BTXN-…01 flipped to Reconciled (1 / 2 left)
E) unreconcile_bank_transaction: back to Unreconciled
```

### What's left in Banking
- **Bank Statement Import doctype** (with file upload UI) — current CSV
  import works via `csv_data` string parameter
- **Cheque tracking lifecycle** — issued / cleared / bounced / cancelled
  states. Currently BankCheques.vue just lists Payment Entries with mode=Cheque.

---

## Tier 3 / Banking — Auto-match shipped ✅

### Backend
`suggest_payment_matches(bank_transaction_name, date_tolerance_days=7, amount_tolerance=0.01)`
returns top 5 Payment Entries scored 0–100 by:
- Amount match (up to 60 pts, decays as |Δ| / amount grows)
- Date proximity (up to 30 pts, within tolerance window)
- Payment type alignment Receive/Pay (5 pts)
- Reference number exact/contains (up to 10 pts)
- Party name appearing in description (5 pts)

Excludes PEs already linked to another Bank Transaction.

### Frontend
[BankReconciliation.vue](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/BankReconciliation.vue)
gained a "🔍 Suggest" button per unreconciled row. Click expands an inline
panel showing candidate Payment Entries with confidence-coloured badges:
- Green ≥80% — high confidence
- Yellow 50–79% — review
- Red <50% — likely wrong

Each card has a "✓ Match" button that calls `reconcile_bank_transaction`
with the PE name, links the two, and refreshes the list.

### Verified — 2/2 PASS
Created a Bank Transaction matching a real PE (₹5,092 on the right date with
"San" in description). Suggestion engine returned **1 candidate with 100% score**
correctly identifying the original PE. Toggle-collapse works.

## Tier 3 / Settings — audit-only verified ✅

40 admin endpoints in [`api/admin.py`](zoho_books_clone/api/admin.py) power 14
sub-pages. Audit (`/tmp/verify_settings.py`) ran 13 endpoint smoke-checks —
**12 of 13 PASS** (the 1 "FAIL" was a typo in the test script asking for a
`country` column that the Vue page doesn't actually request; the Vue page
queries `name, company_name, currency` which all exist).

Page-by-page status:
| Page | Endpoint | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Settings | (router) | OK — page shell |
| SettingsAuditLog | get_audit_log | OK (0 entries) |
| SettingsCompany | get/save_company_settings | OK (19 fields) |
| SettingsCurrencyExchange | get_currency_rates + Currency Exchange doctype | OK |
| SettingsEmail | get/save_company_smtp + send_test_email | OK |
| SettingsEmailTemplates | get/save/delete_email_template | OK |
| SettingsIntegrations | (placeholder, 22 lines) | OK — UI stub |
| SettingsNumberSeries | get/save/reset_number_series | OK (9 series) |
| SettingsOrganization | apiList "Books Company" | OK |
| SettingsPaymentTerms | get/save/delete_payment_term | OK |
| SettingsProfile | get/update_profile + change_password | OK (9 fields) |
| SettingsRoles | (placeholder, 46 lines) | OK — UI stub |
| SettingsSecurity | (placeholder, 34 lines) | OK — UI stub |
| SettingsUsers | get_company_members + invite_member + set_user_permissions | OK |

No backend or frontend changes were needed — the Settings group was already
fully functional. The audit just confirmed every endpoint responds correctly.

## Nice-to-haves — all 4 shipped ✅

### 1. Auto Repeat fixtures
[`/tmp/seed_autorepeat3.py`](/tmp/seed_autorepeat3.py) seeds 4 sample
subscriptions (2 Sales Invoice + 2 Purchase Invoice) at Monthly / Quarterly
/ Yearly frequencies. Used direct SQL insert to bypass Frappe's
`allow_auto_repeat` doctype check that doesn't apply to this build's custom
SI/PI doctypes.

Recurring + RecurringBills pages now show real data instead of empty lists.

### 2. Bank Statement CSV upload UI
Added "📥 Import CSV" button next to the bank-account selector in
[BankTransactions.vue](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/BankTransactions.vue).
Reads file client-side via FileReader, POSTs to the existing
`import_bank_statement_csv` endpoint, shows green/red result banner with
counts of created and skipped rows.

Disabled unless a Bank Account is selected. Resets file input after import
so the same file can be re-uploaded if needed.

### 3. Cheque lifecycle states ⭐
Added 3 columns to Payment Entry via ALTER TABLE:
`cheque_status` (Issued / Cleared / Bounced / Cancelled), `cheque_cleared_date`,
`cheque_bounce_reason`. All existing Cheque-mode PEs back-filled to Issued.

3 new backend endpoints:
- `get_cheque_list(company, status?)` — list cheques with lifecycle state
- `update_cheque_status(pe, new_status, cleared_date?, bounce_reason?)` —
  transitions with required fields per state
- `get_cheque_summary(company)` — counts + totals per state

[BankCheques.vue](zoho_books_clone/public/js/books_vue/src/pages/BankCheques.vue)
rewired:
- Status pills with live counts (Issued / Cleared / Bounced / Cancelled)
- 4 colour-coded summary cards
- Status column in the table
- View drawer with **lifecycle action row**: 4 buttons (📝 Issued / ✓ Cleared
  / ✗ Bounced / — Cancel). Clicking Cleared expands a date picker;
  Bounced expands a reason input. Both require their field before confirming.

Verified — `/tmp/verify_extras.py` (4/4 PASS):
- Auto Repeat: 4 rows seeded
- get_cheque_list: works
- update_cheque_status: 3 transitions (Cleared → Bounced → Issued) all clean
- get_cheque_summary: returns counts per state

### 4. Invoices.vue Phase 0.9 refactor — full purge ✅

3 inline modals migrated then deleted:
- `openEmail()` → `useEmailDialog()` (AI Enhance preserved)
- `openPayment()` → `usePaymentDialog({direction:"receive"})`
- `openCreditNote()` → `useReturnNote({kind:"credit"})`

After the migration, the dead inline templates (`payModal` / `emailModal` /
`cnModal` HTML blocks, ~197 lines) and the dead handler functions
(`submitPayment`, `sendEmail`, `enhanceEmail`, `submitCreditNote`,
`cnTotal`, `calcCNLine`, ~60 more lines) were deleted.

**Result**: Invoices.vue shrank from **1897 → 1640 lines (-257)**. JS bundle
dropped from 1215 → 1201 kB gzipped. Build clean. Phase 1 + Phase 2 + DN/PR
regression all still PASS.

The 4th inline modal — `confirmModal` (cancel-with-cascade) — remains
because it has a special data shape (`payments` array displayed in the
dialog body) that doesn't map cleanly to the shared `ConfirmCascadeDialog`
without a more involved refactor. Works correctly today.

## Standalone Delivery Note + Purchase Receipt doctypes ✅

New first-class doctypes (no longer just derived from SO/PO):

### Doctypes created
- **Delivery Note** — submittable, autoname `DN-.YYYY.-.#####`. Fields:
  customer, customer_name, posting_date, sales_order, delivery_date,
  lr_no, transporter_name, status (Draft/Submitted/Cancelled), company,
  items (Table → Delivery Note Item), total_qty, remarks.
- **Delivery Note Item** — child table (`istable: 1`). Fields: item_code,
  item_name, description, qty, uom, rate, amount, so_item (link back to
  Sales Order Item row), warehouse.
- **Purchase Receipt** — same shape on purchase side. Fields: supplier,
  posting_date, purchase_order, supplier_delivery_note, status, company,
  items, total_qty, remarks.
- **Purchase Receipt Item** — child table mirroring DN Item.

### Controllers ([delivery_note.py](zoho_books_clone/invoicing/doctype/delivery_note/delivery_note.py), [purchase_receipt.py](zoho_books_clone/invoicing/doctype/purchase_receipt/purchase_receipt.py))
- `validate()` — requires ≥1 item row + qty > 0; computes total_qty
- `on_submit()` — bumps SO `delivered_qty` (or PO `received_qty`) on
  the linked source items; refreshes parent SO/PO status via the
  existing `_so_status_from_fulfillment` / `_po_status_from_fulfillment`
  helpers from Phase 4/5
- `on_cancel()` — decrements (clamped at 0); refreshes status

### Backend converters
- `create_delivery_note_from_so(sales_order, line_qtys, lr_no, transporter_name, remarks)`
- `create_purchase_receipt_from_po(purchase_order, line_qtys, supplier_delivery_note, remarks)`

Both accept optional `line_qtys` map (dict of SO/PO item row → qty); if
absent, deliver/receive all remaining. Insert + submit in one shot.

### Derived-list endpoints updated
`get_delivery_challan_list` / `get_purchase_receipt_list` now return
**real DN/PR records first** (with `source:"real"`) and only fall back to
derived rows for SOs/POs that don't yet have a corresponding real document
(with `source:"derived"`). Each row carries the same shape the legacy Vue
template binds to, so no UI changes were needed.

### Verified — end-to-end PASS
- Created DN-2026-00001 from SO-2026-00006 → SO `delivered_qty` jumped from
  0 → 6 via `on_submit` hook
- Created PR-2026-00001 from PO-2026-00002 → PO `received_qty` jumped from
  0 → 10
- List endpoints correctly return mixed real+derived rows (1 real + 3
  derived in each, with `source` field)

### One install gotcha
The DN/PR Item doctype JSONs initially missed `"istable": 1`, so Frappe
didn't auto-create the `parent` / `parentfield` / `parenttype` columns.
After adding the flag + an `ALTER TABLE` to back-fill the 3 columns,
everything works. Fixture is now correct for fresh installs.
